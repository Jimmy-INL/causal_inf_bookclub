# Introduciton Notes

## [Introduction](https://mixtape.scunning.com/introduction.html#introduction)
* Little experiences caused big changes in the direction of Scott's life
  * Same thing happened to me!
* So how would I define causal inference? 
  * Causal inference is the leveraging of theory and deep knowledge of institutional details to estimate the impact of events and choices on a given outcome of interest

## [What Is Causal Inference?](https://mixtape.scunning.com/introduction.html#what-is-causal-inference)
* It was written first and foremost for practitioners, which is why it includes easy-to-download data sets and programs. 


## [Do Not Confuse Correlation with Causality](https://mixtape.scunning.com/introduction.html#do-not-confuse-correlation-with-causality)
* It is the presence of randomness that is crucial for identifying causal effect.

## [Optimization Makes Everything Endogenous](https://mixtape.scunning.com/introduction.html#optimization-makes-everything-endogenous)
* Choices are endogenous, and therefore since they are, the correlations between those choices and outcomes in the aggregate will rarely, if ever, represent a causal effect
* The actual methods employed in causal designs are always deeply dependent on theory and local institutional knowledge
* That without prior knowledge, estimated causal effects are rarely, if ever, believable. Prior knowledge is required in order to justify any claim of a causal finding

## [Example: Identifying Price Elasticity of Demand](https://mixtape.scunning.com/introduction.html#example-identifying-price-elasticity-of-demand)
* At this point I don't know too much about P or Q or the underlying assumptions about this model
  * Scott says he'll bring it up later so I'm excited to see what that is

## [Conclusion](https://mixtape.scunning.com/introduction.html#conclusion)
* I'm going to use python. 
  * People can use whatever they want
  * All program files seem to be available here https://github.com/scunning1975/mixtape
